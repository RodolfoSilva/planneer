# Project Proposal: Generative AI for .XER File Projects

## Problem Statement

Creating project schedules in Primavera P6 is a time-consuming and expertise-intensive process. Project managers and schedulers face the challenge of:

1. **Manual Schedule Creation**: Building project schedules from scratch requires deep domain knowledge and significant time investment
2. **Knowledge Loss**: Valuable scheduling patterns and best practices from past projects are not easily reusable
3. **Inconsistency**: Different schedulers may create different structures for similar projects, leading to inconsistent quality
4. **Limited Scalability**: Creating schedules manually doesn't scale well for organizations managing multiple projects

## Solution: AI-Powered Schedule Generation with RAG

Planneer is a generative AI platform that uses **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** to automatically create project schedules by learning from historical .XER files and generating new, customized schedules based on user specifications.

## How It Works

### 1. Knowledge Base from Historical .XER Files

- Users upload existing .XER files (Primavera P6 project files) as templates
- The system parses these files to extract:
  - Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
  - Activities and their relationships
  - Durations and dependencies
  - Resource assignments
  - Project metadata (type, domain, complexity)
- Each template is converted to embeddings and stored in a vector database (pgvector)
- This creates a searchable knowledge base of project scheduling patterns

### 2. User Specification & Contextual Conversation

- User describes their project:
  - Project type (construction, IT, maintenance, engineering, etc.)
  - Project description and requirements
  - Specific constraints or preferences
- The AI engages in a conversational flow to:
  - Understand project specifics
  - Ask clarifying questions
  - Refine requirements based on similar historical projects

### 3. RAG-Based Schedule Generation

- The system uses RAG to:
  1. **Retrieve**: Find similar historical projects from the vector database using semantic search
  2. **Augment**: Use the retrieved project structures as context
  3. **Generate**: Create a new schedule that combines:
     - Patterns from similar historical projects
     - User's specific requirements
     - Best practices learned from the knowledge base

### 4. Output: Customized .XER File

- The AI generates a complete project schedule including:
  - Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) hierarchy
  - Activities with proper naming and organization
  - Realistic durations based on historical data
  - Predecessor relationships (dependencies)
  - Resource assignments
  - Calendar definitions
- The schedule is exported as a .XER file ready to import into Primavera P6
- Users can also view and interact with the schedule in the web interface

## Key Concepts

### .XER Files

- **XER** (Xerox Export/Import) is Primavera P6's native file format
- Contains complete project schedule data: activities, resources, relationships, calendars, etc.
- Binary format that can be parsed and generated programmatically
- The standard format for exchanging Primavera P6 project data

### RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)

- **Retrieval**: Semantic search through historical .XER files using vector embeddings
- **Augmentation**: Enriching LLM prompts with relevant context from similar projects
- **Generation**: Creating new schedules that combine historical patterns with user requirements

### Workflow

```
User Input (Project Description)
    ↓
AI Conversation (Clarifying Questions)
    ↓
RAG Retrieval (Find Similar Projects)
    ↓
AI Generation (Create Schedule Structure)

Schedule Generation (WBS, Activities, Dependencies)

.XER File Export (Primavera P6 Compatible)
```

## Technical Implementation

### Import Pipeline

1. **Upload**: User uploads .XER file via API
2. **Parse**: Extract project structure using `xer-parser` library
3. **Transform**: Convert to internal data model (schedules, activities, resources)
4. **Embed**: Generate embeddings from project description and structure
5. **Store**: Save to PostgreSQL with vector embeddings in pgvector

### Generation Pipeline

1. **Query Understanding**: Process user's project description
2. **Vector Search**: Find top-k similar projects using cosine similarity
3. **Context Building**: Extract relevant patterns from similar projects
4. **LLM Generation**: Use OpenAI/Anthropic to generate schedule structure
5. **Validation**: Ensure schedule follows Primavera P6 constraints
6. **XER Export**: Generate .XER file using custom generator

## Use Cases

- **Construction Projects**: Generate schedules for building construction, infrastructure, etc.
- **IT Projects**: Software development, system implementations, migrations
- **Maintenance Projects**: Industrial maintenance, facility management
- **Engineering Projects**: Design projects, engineering studies
- **Any Project Type**: As long as historical .XER templates are available

## Value Proposition

1. **Time Savings**: Reduce schedule creation time from days/weeks to minutes
2. **Consistency**: Leverage proven patterns from successful projects
3. **Knowledge Preservation**: Capture and reuse organizational scheduling expertise
4. **Scalability**: Generate multiple schedules quickly for portfolio management
5. **Quality**: Benefit from best practices embedded in historical projects

## When Working on This Project

- Always consider the end goal: generating valid, importable .XER files
- Remember that .XER format has specific requirements and constraints
- Ensure RAG retrieval finds truly similar projects (not just keyword matches)
- Validate generated schedules before export (check for cycles, valid dates, etc.)
- Maintain compatibility with Primavera P6 import requirements
- Consider multi-tenancy: organizations should only see their own templates
- Optimize for both accuracy (correct schedule structure) and usability (user-friendly interface)
